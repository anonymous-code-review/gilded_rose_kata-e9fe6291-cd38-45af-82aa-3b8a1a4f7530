# Gilded Rose in Java with Approval Tests

This folder has a unit test that uses [Approvals](https://github.com/approvals/approvaltests.java)

There are two test cases here with different styles:

* "foo" is more similar to the unit test from the 'Java' version
* "thirtyDays" is more similar to the TextTest from the 'Java' version

I suggest choosing one style to develop and deleting the other.

## Requirements
The requirements for the system are in [GildedRoseRequirements.md](GildedRoseRequirements.md)
The requirements in Spanish are in [GildedRoseRequirements_es.md](GildedRoseRequirements_es.md)
